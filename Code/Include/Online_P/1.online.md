# Online Pear to Pear

This is the api of the Online part of ReKat (With client connection).

## Stucture

Every client is a node to witch other clients connect.

### nodes

There are two magjor node types:

- main node:  
    The main node is the origin of the network. By starting the node in main mode you are generating a new network.
- connection node:
    This node connects to a main node or to another connection node.  
    This node is used to expand the network.

### security

An RSA impmentation is used for the criptaion, for more detatils check the Crypt_core.

Every node has it's key generator and when a node connects it send their public key, and recive the newly connected node public key.

## Usage

Incude in your project ReKat.hpp `(1)` in the parent folder or include the specific implementation for your OS `(2)`.

```cpp
#define ONLINE_PEAR
#include <ReKat.hpp> // (1)

#define ONLINE_PEAR
#include <Online/online.linux.hpp> // (2)
```

The function are defined as follows:

```cpp
namespace ReKat { namespace online {    
    static int Start ( std::string name, int *main_shutdown );

    static int Connect ( );

    static int Send ( const char* _buf, long size);

    static int Recv ( char* _buf, long size);

    static std::vector<std::string> Connected ( );

    static void End ( );
} /* Online */ } // ReKat
```

Since we are creating an active lissening port is encuraged to create a tread when starting and setting main_shutdown to a variable that is set to True at the end of the program, this is to properly ending the function.

You can also call End to force the exit.
